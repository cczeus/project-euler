###Problem 26
Due to the limitations of the python float, I had to create my own functions to calculate out decimals to a much larger degree.
Python's float only contains 11 accurate values, a decimal, and the last digit is rounded. Because of this, it is impossible
to solve this problem using only python's default float calculator.
